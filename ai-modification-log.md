# AI Modification Attempt

## Intent
A lot of links in the footer are 404 and no pages have been made for them can you create all the pages now with depth and understanding and completeless

## Analysis
{
  "filesToModify": ["src/components/AboutUs.tsx", "src/components/PrivacyPolicy.tsx", "src/components/TermsOfService.tsx", "src/components/HelpCenter.tsx", "src/components/CaseStudies.tsx", "src/components/Documentation.tsx", "src/components/Blog.tsx", "src/components/Careers.tsx", "src/components/Press.tsx"],
  "reasoning": "The footer in the application contains several links that are likely 404ing because the corresponding page components haven't been created yet. Based on examining Footer.tsx, we need to create pages for all the links mentioned, including About Us, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Help Center, Case Studies, Documentation, Blog, Careers, and Press.",
  "approach": "Create each of the missing page components with complete content. For each page, I'll create a React component with a proper structure, detailed content, and consistent styling that matches the rest of the application's design language."
}

## AI Response
Based on your request to create the missing pages linked from the footer, I'll provide complete implementations for each page.
